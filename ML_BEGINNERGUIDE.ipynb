If the dataset is labeled, like in our example, the prices of the house are given and we are trying to predict the price for new house, it is a supervised learning. If the dataset is not labeled and we are deriving some relationships in our dataset, this is unsupervised learning. An example is a dataset of customer purchases and we would like to do customer segmentation based on purchased products.\n",
